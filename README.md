# Setup
Install the [SteamworksPY](https://github.com/philippj/SteamworksPy) library. Setup for this library is not as easy as most other, and it involves a few steps:
  - cd into the directory, with the terminal in admin mode, and run: `python setup.py build` and then run: `python setup.py install`
  - clone this repo, and then you can run the `/src/main.py` file.
